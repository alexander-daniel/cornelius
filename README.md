Cornelius lets you grab data from MLB's `/lookup/json` routes. All data is property of MLB Advanced Media, and subject to their [usage terms](http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt).

# Install
```sh
npm install --save cornelius
```

# Usage
```javascript
var cornelius = require('cornelius');
```

## cornelius.search(query)
To search for a player by name, use `cornelius.search`. For best results, the query should be a player surname.
```javascript
cornelius.search('young')
    .then(function (results) {
        // do stuff with search results
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        // handle error
    });
```

## cornelius.get(playerName, key)
To grab a specific player, use `cornelius.get`.
- `playerName` should be the full player's name 
- `key` can be either the team abbreviation (`team_abbrev`), or the player's ID (`player_id`)*

**Find both in search results*

Beware that grabbing a player by their team abbreviation has it's limitations. See the limitations section below.

```javascript
// getting Chris Young of the Kansas City Royals via team abbreviation
cornelius.get('chris young', 'kc')
    .then(function (player) {
        // do stuff with player data
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        //handle error
    });
// getting Chris Young of the Boston Red Sox via player ID
cornelius.get('chris young', '455759')
    .then(function (player) {
        // do stuff with player data
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        //handle error
    });
```

# Limitations
## Team abbreviation as key
`cornelius.get` receives the same results as `cornelius.search`, using the key you provide to determine which player object to return. 

If two players share a name, `team_abbrev` as a key can differentiate between the two. But if they were to also share a team, `team_abbrev` as a key would not work. In such a situation, use the playerâ€™s ID as the key instead.
